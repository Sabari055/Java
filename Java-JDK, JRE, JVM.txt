Java:
    Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language. It is intended to let application developers
    write once, and run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support 
    Java without the need for recompilation. 

1. JDK (Java Development Kit) is a Kit that provides the environment to develop and execute(run) the Java program.
    JDK is a kit(or package) that includes two things
    Development Tools(to provide an environment to develop your java programs)
    JRE (to execute your java program).

2. JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is an installation package that provides an environment to only run(not develop)
    the java program(or application)onto your machine. JRE is only used by those who only want to run Java programs that
    are end-users of your system.

3. JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is a very important part of both JDK and JRE because it is contained or inbuilt in both.
    Whatever Java program you run using JRE or JDK goes into JVM and JVM is responsible for executing the java program
    line by line, hence it is also known as an interpreter.
