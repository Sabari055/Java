Variables:
    A variable is a container which holds the value.

        Types:
            Local, Instance, Static

            Local Variable:
                A variable declared inside the body of the method is called local variable. You can use this variable only within that method and the other methods in the class aren't even aware that the variable exists.

            Instance Variable:
                Instance variables are declared in a class, but outside a method, constructor or any block.
                Instance variables are created when an object is created with the use of the keyword 'new' and destroyed when the object is destroyed.

            Static Variable:
                The keyword "Static" is used for defining a static method or a static property of a class. The benefit of a static method is that we do not need to create an instance or object of the class. It does not have multiple values. It will have a single static value defined during initialization.

DataTypes:

    Primitive:
        Integer, Float, Character, Boolean

        Integer
        *int- 4 bytes
        *long- 8 bytes
        *short- 2 bytes
        *byte- 1 byte

        Float
        *float- 4 bytes
        *double- 8 bytes

        Character
        *char- 2bytes

Class:
    Class is a blue print or logical template for an object that defines the properties of an object and method.
Object:
    A object is a member (also called an instance) of a Java class. Each object has an identity, a behavior and a state.
    The state of an object is stored in fields (variables), while methods (functions) display the object's behavior.

Method Overloading:
    Method Overloading allows different methods to have the same name, but different signatures where the signature
    can differ by the number of input parameters or type of input parameters, or a mixture of both.

    Method overloading in Java is also known as Compile-time Polymorphism, Static Polymorphism, or Early binding.
    In Method overloading compared to the parent argument, the child argument will get the highest priority.
